## About
The **Online Expense Tracker** was developed as a final project for the Software Engineering course (CS 3365). This application is designed to help users efficiently manage and analyze their expenses, with features for recording purchases, generating monthly reports, and utilizing a financial calculator. Through a user-friendly web interface, it provides a comprehensive solution for budgeting and tracking expenses.

## Description
The **Online Expense Tracker** is a web application developed with python and flask that combines expense tracking with financial calculation tools. Users can log grocery and other expenses, generate detailed monthly summaries, and perform essential financial calculations. The application supports individual expense entries and bulk uploads, allowing users to maintain organized records and monitor their spending patterns.

### Features
